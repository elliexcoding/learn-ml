# Deep Learning for Computer Vision

Exploratory studies into the use of machine learning for computer vision as taught at the Uni. of Michigan.

All assignments were done with PyTorch and Google Colab

###### KNN, Linear, and Two Layer
nearest-neighbor: Intro to image classification and implementation of kNN classifier
linear-classifer: Study into Softmax and SVM
two-layer-neural-network: A two layer neural network classifier

###### Full Neural and Convolutional
full-connect-neural-network: A fully connected neural network with different flavours of descent in addition to SGD along with Dropout implementation.
convolutional-network: WIP
